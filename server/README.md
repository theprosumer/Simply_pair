A RESTful Food/Drink Pairing App Made with Ruby, Sinatra, and Active Record, designed for mobile applications.


User Story:
The user is planning a meal.  They can be at the store, on the way to the store, planning a meal for the week or even after ordering your meals from a popular meal service.

1. The user goes to the app and registers as a new user.  They are automatically logged in.

2. Once logged in, the user sees a visual navigation menu where they can Simply, choose to pair from the starting point of wines, beers and foods. At the bottom of this menu a user can also navigate
to a page where they can add their own favorite pairs. This allows the user to add very specific detail about their pairs, like dishes, wine brands, and beer brands.

3. After making a selection the user will see s simple list of basic categories of either foods, wines, or beers, that offer a simple encapsulation of most food, wine and beer styles.

4. The user can now again click on one of those categories to display a suggested list of pairs.
	- Beer: Displays a list of food types that pair with that beer style
	- Wine: Displays a list of food types that pair with that wine style
	- Food: Displays a list of BOTH food and beer types that pair with that food.

5. For Wines, the user will see a list of varietals that they can click on.  By clicking a varietal
the user is returned a list of up to 100 orderable wine results.

6.  By clicking on a wine the user is taken from the app to wine.com page for that item.
